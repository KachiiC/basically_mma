Punches \n            and kicks are not so easily blocked like they are with 8 or 10oz gloves. Secondly, \n            a fighter transitioning from another combat sport must also reconsider their guard \n            and footwork. Having a narrow stance (feet to close together) or a high guard \n            (hands protecting the chin), will leave you more vulnerable to body/leg kicks and \n            being takedowns. Thirdly, overcommitting to strikes will result in fighters ending \n            up in the clinch, somewhere a high level stand up striker does not want to be. \n            Finally, there are not breaks in clinches (unless there is a lull in the action) and \n            standing count when a fighter is knocked down.\n        </p>\n    </>\n)\n\nexport default StrikingModalData","import React from 'react'\n\nconst GrapplingModalData = () => (\n    <>\n        <p>\n            The most gruelling part of MMA is grappling. In the early days of the UFC grapplers \n            dominated the sport as strikers had no answer for them when the distance was closed. \n            In modern MMA, virtually every fighter can grapple to some extent but often dominate \n            grapplers will decide where the fight takes place. For example against a high level \n            striker, they would want to nullify their striking by taking them to the mat. However, \n            against a high level Jiu-jitsu specialist with great submissions, they will using their \n            grappling to defend takedowns and keep the fight standing to avoid the submission threat.\n        </p>\n        <p>Like striking, high level (even world champion) grapplers don’t always transition well, \n            if a grappler recklessly closes the distance they are be knocked out by inferior grapples \n            who have better distance management and stand up striking. In grappling combat sports \n            such as wrestling and jiu-jitsu, strikes are not often thrown, so this changes the dynamic \n            of how their grappling transitions in mma. For example, having top position in jiu-jitsu is \n            not necessarily important but in MMA it gives you more leverage to strike a grounded opponent \n            and is seen more favourably on the judges scorecard.\n        </p>\n    </>\n)\n\nexport default GrapplingModalData","import React from 'react'\n\nconst GamePlanningModalData = () => (\n    <>\n        <p>\n            Each fighter (at least on paper) will always have strengths and weaknesses relative \n            to his/her opponent. So preparring a game plan with your coaches beforehand will \n            increase your chances of winning. Fighters may choose to focus on their own strengths \n            and implement their game plan around that. For example, an olympic gold medalist in \n            wrestling may choose to take down their opponents and strike them on the ground, as \n            they are confident in taking down their opponent regardless of who they are. Other \n            fighters may choose to exploit the weaknesses of their opponent. As an Olympic gold \n            medalist in wrestling, if you know your opponent is not a good stand up striker but is \n            a 5 time Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion, with a high submission rate, you may instead \n            plan to keep the fight standing at all cost to avoid submissions.  \n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Coaches will know what their fighters are capable of, so it’s up to them to prepare \n            their fighter adequately before the contest.

Aside from the \n                scheduled duration of their fights, fighters train for months during \"training camps\" \n                in prepration for their fights. With the high risk of injuries during training and \n                fights, the long term brain damage and emotional stress of competing, fighters can \n                be forgiven for asking their promoters for thousands (if not millions) of dollars to \n                compete in MMA. With the increasing popularity of MMA, most professional fighters \n                would argue that they are underpaid by their promoters and Amatuer fighters are \n                not paid at all. \n            </p>\n\n            <p>So how much should MMA fighters be paid?

The UFC is the \n            biggest and respected promotion in MMA, more importantly it's where you can earn \n            the most money. Needless to say, you can early a lot of money in other promotions, \n            but being in the biggest stage worldwide. \n        </p>\n        <h6>Fight Night Pay and Bonuses</h6>\n        <p>\n            Most UFC fighter's contracts are structed as show money and win bonus. This means \n            fighters are paid when they fight and a bonus if they win, with the show and win \n            bonus usually being the same amount. A typical amount for a fighter making his UFC\n            debut would be $10,000 to show and $10,000 to win. A UFC fighter on average will\n            compete up to 3 times a year, although due to injuries and scheduling this is rarely\n            the case for higher level fighters. The UFC are contractly obliged to offer you three\n            fights a year (unless you are injured), if they do not offer you those three fights\n            they will pay you regardless.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            During each event, all fighters (unless they miss weight) are eligible to fight \n            night bonuses. A $50,000 bonus is given to both fighters who compete in the \n            \"Fight of the night\" and two additional bonuses to \"performance of the night”. \n            Historically, UFC president Dana White and former CEO Lorenzo Fertitta have also \n            given fighters undisclosed fight night bonuses.\n        </p>\n        <h6>The Reebok Sponsorship Deal</h6>\n        <p>\n            In 2015, the UFC announced Reebok as its official apparel partner. This was \n            a huge step for the UFC and the sport of MMA in general, according to UFC \n            President Dana White the deal was done in order to “clean up the image of \n            the sport”. Before the Reebok deal, sponsors would pay fighters to wear their \n            merchandise before and after fights. Fighters would also have multiple logos \n            printed on their shorts for fight night. For fighters outside of the UFC, \n            this is still the case. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Reebok deal meant that all UFC athletes can only wear or use reebok \n            equipment during fight week. Promoting other brands during media days, press \n            conferences, weigh ins and post fight were no longer permitted and athletes \n            who did so would be fined by the UFC. The UFC’s biggest stars (for example \n            Conor McGregor) will have sponsorship separate deals with Reebok and would \n            earn a lot more as a result. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The benefit of this Reebok deal is that new fighters will not have to go out \n            and find sponsors. During the early portions of their career, sponsors will \n            not pay fighters much (if anything) to promote their brand. Understandably so, \n            fighters with only 5 professional fights will not bring much attention for a \n            sponsor so it’s hard to justify paying them even $1,000. However, with the Reebok \n            deal, even if you are the first fight of the night, you’ll earn $3,500 from Reebok.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The problem with the Reebok deal is that it caps the earning potential for \n            most of its fighters. In boxing for example fighters earn hundreds of thousands \n            for shorts sponsors alone. During fight week where MMA fighters will draw the \n            most attention due to their media obligations, only being able to promote reebok \n            reduces their earning potential.\n        </p>\n        <ReebokMoney />\n    </>\n)\n\nexport default UFCFighterMoney","import React from 'react'\n// CSS\nimport \"./FightPay.css\"\n// Components\nimport PromotionsMoney from './PageComponents/PromotionMoney'\nimport FighterMoney from './PageComponents/FighterMoney'\nimport UFCFighterMoney from './PageComponents/UFCFighterMoney'\n\nconst FighterPay = () => (\n        <>\n            <PromotionsMoney />\n            <FighterMoney />\n            <UFCFighterMoney />\n        </>\n)\n\nexport default FighterPay","import React from 'react'\n//Icons\nimport LocalDrinkIcon from '@material-ui/icons/LocalDrink';\nimport FitnessCenterIcon from '@material-ui/icons/FitnessCenter';\nimport SportsKabaddiIcon from '@material-ui/icons/SportsKabaddi';\nimport EventBusyIcon from '@material-ui/icons/EventBusy';\nimport WcIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Wc';\nimport AccessibilityIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Accessibility';\n\nconst WeightCutData = [\n    {\n      icon: <SportsKabaddiIcon />,\n      description: \"Find your optimal fighting weight, the weight you perform best during training\"\n    },\n    {\n      icon: <LocalDrinkIcon />,\n      description: \"You should be entering fight week fully hydrated and at your optimal fight weight.\"\n    },\n    {\n      icon: <WcIcon />,\n      description: \"Female fighters physically can’t cut as much as male fighters.\"\n    },\n    {\n      icon: <FitnessCenterIcon />,\n      description: \"Muscle stores more water, the better shape you’re in, the more weight you can cut\"\n    },\n    {\n      icon: <AccessibilityIcon />,\n      description: \"If you are cutting less than 10% of your body weight, you consider moving down a weight class.\"\n    },\n    {\n      icon: <EventBusyIcon />,\n      description: \"The older you are, the harder it will become to cut weight.

As rules \n                    evolved and regulations added, different branches of mixed martial arts have \n                    emerged, with differences between the different rulesets dictating different \n                    strategies.\n                </p>\n                <p>The main motivations for these rule changes were to protect the health of the \n                    fighters.

A beginner will need \n            to learn basic striking and grappling techniques, become well conditioned and \n            develop an understanding of nutrition. It is important to take into account that \n            not all beginners will be equal, some will be more athletically gifted and some \n            may be more committed to learning. Beginners will have different body shapes and \n            sizes so it will important to figure out the advantages of your body type when \n            prioritising what you want to be good at. For example, short and stocky fighters \n            are more likely to be powerful strikers and stronger grapplers, tall and skinny \n            fighters can develop into good counter strikers and have better leverage when it \n            comes to choke submissions.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Fighters transitioning from another martial art will have a general understanding \n            of some of the fundamentals. Let’s take a boxer transitioning to MMA as an example, \n            a well trained boxer would probably have a good understanding of how to strike, the \n            level of endurance and nutirition needed to train. This would in theory give them a \n            distinct advantage over an absolute beginner. However, a boxer will have habits such \n            as footwork or clinching when stunned that need to be corrected before becoming \n            successful at MMA. A boxer with no grappling background may still struggle against a \n            low level grappler who has only been drilling for a few months. This is not to say \n            boxers will never succeed but if your game plan is to win with strikes, then an \n            emphasis must also be placed grappling defence. Below I have outlined six fundamentals \n            which I feel are most important to fighters when competing in MMA.\n        </p>\n    </>\n)\n\nexport default FundamentalsIntroduction;","import React from 'react'\n\nconst TechniquesIntroduction = () => (\n        <>\n            <h1>Techniques and Positions</h1>\n            <p>Techniques in MMA are generally categorised as either striking and \n                grappling techniques. Striking is any technique which involves punches, \n                kicks, elbows or knees. Although strikes can be thrown on the ground in MMA \n                (commonly referred to as ground and pound), striking is often a term used for \n                techniques used from a standing position. Grappling techniques are a combination \n                of wrestling, judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Techniques used in grappling include \n                takedowns, trips, throws, sweeps, clinching and submission holds. Strikes are \n                often used in grappling exchanges when fighters are jostling for position.\n            </p>\n            <p>Below is a list of the most commonly used techniques used in MMA:</p>\n        </>\n    )\n\nexport default TechniquesIntroduction","import React from 'react'\n\nconst FightStrategiesIntro = () => (\n        <>\n            <h1>Fight Strategies</h1>\n            <p> \n                As a mixed martial artist, you will not only come up against fighters of all \n                shapes and sizes but also fighters with different fighting styles. A fighter \n                (at least on paper) will always have strengths and weaknesses relative to his/her \n                opponent. Preparing a game plan for your scheduled opponent will minimise the risk \n                of being surprised during a fight. Fighters and coaches can either exploit the \n                weaknesses of their opponent or overpower their opponent by impose their skillset.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Let’s use a kickboxing world champion as an example. Naturally they should have an \n                advantage in stand up striking against a world champion Brazilian jiu-jitsu artist. \n                Therefore, the smartest gameplay for the kickboxer would be to keep the fight standing \n                and avoid being taken down at all cost (sprawl and brawl). Let’s assume in this scenario \n                that the BJJ artist will try to submit the kickboxer and avoid the standup at all cost. \n                Even if the kickboxer’s bjj skills were at a high level, inviting a take down against \n                a world champion BJJ artist and trying to submit them is not the easiest route to \n                victory - when you can easily knockout them out on the feet. It’s far better to \n                understand your strengths and weakness over your opponent before a contest than being \n                surprised during the fight.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Below is a list of the most common fight strategies in mixed martial arts.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    )\n\nexport default FightStrategiesIntro","import React from 'react'\n\nconst FighterPayIntroduction = () => (\n    <>\n        <h1>Fighter Pay</h1>\n        <p>\n            The more you follow the sport, the more you will begin to hear about Fighter Pay. \n            At the end of the day, combat sports is prize fighting so negoiating pay is a huge \n            part of any sport. Fighter pay is often discussed privately and understandably so, \n            having your salary announced to the work would be uncomfortable to anymore let alone \n            prize fighters. Although as fans and observers we maybe interested in how much our \n            favourite athletes are paid, in MMA most promotions are mostly private companies, \n            so they are under no obligation to disclose their fighter’s pay. Some athletic \n            commissions such as Nevada and California require promotions to disclosure fighter \n            pay when events are held in their state. \n        </p>\n    </>\n)\n\nexport default FighterPayIntroduction","import React from 'react'\n\nconst WeightClassesIntroduction = () => (\n    <>\n        <h1>Weight Classes</h1>\n        <p>\n            Before weight classes existed, fighters would compete in open weight tournments.\n            In a time where the sport did not yet have a name and prior to state sanctioning, \n            weight classes were not mandatory since the competitions were held without the approval \n            of the athletic commissions. The UFC first introduced two weight classes at UFC 12, \n            which grouped competitors above 200 lb (91 kg) as heavyweights and competitors \n            under 200 lb as lightweights. Weight divisions underwent many changes in the \n            years to follow, but the ability for promotions to autonomously decide their own \n            weight classes eventually disappeared after athletic commissions began supervising \n            mixed martial arts.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were codified by the New Jersey \n            State Athletic Commission. The California State Athletic Commission had worked \n            extensively on regulation, but their sanctioning of MMA was not implemented due to \n            state governmental issues surrounding the process. California officially sanctioned\n            MMA on December 28, 2005, using the ruleset it helped devise five years previously.\n            Since then, to create uniformity, all state commissions in the United States that\n            regulate mixed martial arts have assimilated these rules into their existing \n            unarmed combat competition rules and statutes. For a promotion to hold mixed \n            martial arts events in a state-sanctioned venue, the promotion must abide by the \n            state athletic commission's body of rules for weight limits.\n        </p>\n    </>\n)\n    \n\n\nexport default WeightClassesIntroduction","import React from 'react'\n\nconst PromotionsIntroduction = () => (\n    <>\n        <h1>MMA Promotions</h1>\n        <p>\n            Today no companies have presented significant competition to the UFC which is regarded as \n            having most of the top ranked talent.

Some MMA \n            promotions tend to exist more to build up prospects while others have a good mix of \n            prospects and veterans.
