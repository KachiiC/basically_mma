        <p>Every mixed martial arts contest starts on the feet, so being comfortable striking 
            and defending against strikes is critical for any mixed martial artist. Being good 
            at a striking martial such as boxing, kickboxing, muaythai or taekwondo will often 
            give MMA fighters a huge advantage in the standup. Although not expressly stated, 
            striking is more fan friendly than grappling as fans love to see knockouts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although having a stand up striking base generally gives you an advantage, MMA striking 
            is different to striking in other combat sports. Firstly most other combat sports will 
            not use the small 4ounce gloves, so blocking strikes in MMA is a lot harder. Punches 
            and kicks are not so easily blocked like they are with 8 or 10oz gloves. Secondly, 
            a fighter transitioning from another combat sport must also reconsider their guard 
            and footwork. Having a narrow stance (feet to close together) or a high guard 
            (hands protecting the chin), will leave you more vulnerable to body/leg kicks and 
            being takedowns. Thirdly, overcommitting to strikes will result in fighters ending 
            up in the clinch, somewhere a high level stand up striker does not want to be. 
            Finally, there are not breaks in clinches (unless there is a lull in the action) and 
            standing count when a fighter is knocked down.

            The most gruelling part of MMA is grappling. In the early days of the UFC grapplers 
            dominated the sport as strikers had no answer for them when the distance was closed. 
            In modern MMA, virtually every fighter can grapple to some extent but often dominate 
            grapplers will decide where the fight takes place. For example against a high level 
            striker, they would want to nullify their striking by taking them to the mat. However, 
            against a high level Jiu-jitsu specialist with great submissions, they will using their 
            grappling to defend takedowns and keep the fight standing to avoid the submission threat.
        </p>
        <p>Like striking, high level (even world champion) grapplers don’t always transition well, 
            if a grappler recklessly closes the distance they are be knocked out by inferior grapples 
            who have better distance management and stand up striking. In grappling combat sports 
            such as wrestling and jiu-jitsu, strikes are not often thrown, so this changes the dynamic 
            of how their grappling transitions in mma. For example, having top position in jiu-jitsu is 
            not necessarily important but in MMA it gives you more leverage to strike a grounded opponent 
            and is seen more favourably on the judges scorecard.

            Each fighter (at least on paper) will always have strengths and weaknesses relative 
            to his/her opponent. So preparring a game plan with your coaches beforehand will 
            increase your chances of winning. Fighters may choose to focus on their own strengths 
            and implement their game plan around that. For example, an olympic gold medalist in 
            wrestling may choose to take down their opponents and strike them on the ground, as 
            they are confident in taking down their opponent regardless of who they are. Other 
            fighters may choose to exploit the weaknesses of their opponent. As an Olympic gold 
            medalist in wrestling, if you know your opponent is not a good stand up striker but is 
            a 5 time Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion, with a high submission rate, you may instead 
            plan to keep the fight standing at all cost to avoid submissions.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Coaches will know what their fighters are capable of, so it’s up to them to prepare 
            their fighter adequately before the contest. Although coaches and fighters may have a 
            pre-fight plan and an idea of how they think/want the fight to play out, the best 
            fighters will make adjustments during the fight (often in-between rounds after advice 
            from their coaches).

            If you want to get in shape then training like a professional MMA fighter is a good way 
            to achieve exactly that. But there’s a lot more to being a professional athlete than 
            just training regularly. In truth, it’s an entire lifestyle commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your diet is arguably the most important aspect of that lifestyle commitment. Without 
            adequate fuel, you just won’t have the energy to train at 100%. And even when you do 
            train, your body won’t feel the full benefits if you have an unhealthy diet.

            Conditioning training is a ‘buzzword’ that is often interchanged with the word ‘fitness.’ You’ll 
            often hear martial artists and fighters talk about what they do for conditioning, or will finish 
            their training with extra conditioning on the mats usually consisting of running or circuit 
            training. Outside of fight training, their martial arts conditioning may involve road running, 
            hill sprints, suicide runs, and every endurance activity in-between.
        </p>
        <p>
            But why does conditioning only refer to ‘fitness?’ I’d assume it’s because of the rise in 
            popularity of the term ‘strength and conditioning’ where strength refers to what you do in 
            the gym and conditioning refers to what you do outside of it. However, to get conditioned 
            for your sport, it is more than just ‘fitness.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Conditioning training refers to being conditioned for the sport. That means being able to 
            throw a volume of strikes without gassing out, or holding strong isometric grip and leg 
            contractions during grappling without fatiguing. That means being conditioned, and the 
            subsequent conditioning training, is going to be different for different sports and martial arts.
