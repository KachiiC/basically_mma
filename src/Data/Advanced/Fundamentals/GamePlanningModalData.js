        <p>
            Each fighter (at least on paper) will always have strengths and weaknesses relative 
            to his/her opponent. So preparring a game plan with your coaches beforehand will 
            increase your chances of winning. Fighters may choose to focus on their own strengths 
            and implement their game plan around that. For example, an olympic gold medalist in 
            wrestling may choose to take down their opponents and strike them on the ground, as 
            they are confident in taking down their opponent regardless of who they are. Other 
            fighters may choose to exploit the weaknesses of their opponent. As an Olympic gold 
            medalist in wrestling, if you know your opponent is not a good stand up striker but is 
            a 5 time Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion, with a high submission rate, you may instead 
            plan to keep the fight standing at all cost to avoid submissions.

            Coaches will know what their fighters are capable of, so itâ€™s up to them to prepare 
            their fighter adequately before the contest. Although coaches and fighters may have a 
            pre-fight plan and an idea of how they think/want the fight to play out, the best 
            fighters will make adjustments during the fight (often in-between rounds after advice 
            from their coaches).
