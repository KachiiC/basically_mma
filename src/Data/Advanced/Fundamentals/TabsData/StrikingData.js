        <p>Every mixed martial arts contest starts on the feet, so being comfortable striking 
            and defending against strikes is critical for any mixed martial artist. Being good 
            at a striking martial such as boxing, kickboxing, muaythai or taekwondo will often 
            give MMA fighters a huge advantage in the standup. Although not expressly stated, 
            striking is more fan friendly than grappling as fans love to see knockouts.

            Although having a stand up striking base generally gives you an advantage, MMA striking 
            is different to striking in other combat sports. Firstly most other combat sports will 
            not use the small 4ounce gloves, so blocking strikes in MMA is a lot harder. Punches 
            and kicks are not so easily blocked like they are with 8 or 10oz gloves. Secondly, 
            a fighter transitioning from another combat sport must also reconsider their guard 
            and footwork. Having a narrow stance (feet to close together) or a high guard 
            (hands protecting the chin), will leave you more vulnerable to body/leg kicks and 
            being takedowns. Thirdly, overcommitting to strikes will result in fighters ending 
            up in the clinch, somewhere a high level stand up striker does not want to be. 
            Finally, there are not breaks in clinches (unless there is a lull in the action) and 
            standing count when a fighter is knocked down.
