        <p>
            The most gruelling part of MMA is grappling. In the early days of the UFC grapplers 
            dominated the sport as strikers had no answer for them when the distance was closed. 
            In modern MMA, virtually every fighter can grapple to some extent but often dominate 
            grapplers will decide where the fight takes place. For example against a high level 
            striker, they would want to nullify their striking by taking them to the mat. However, 
            against a high level Jiu-jitsu specialist with great submissions, they will using their 
            grappling to defend takedowns and keep the fight standing to avoid the submission threat.

        <p>Like striking, high level (even world champion) grapplers donâ€™t always transition well, 
            if a grappler recklessly closes the distance they are be knocked out by inferior grapples 
            who have better distance management and stand up striking. In grappling combat sports 
            such as wrestling and jiu-jitsu, strikes are not often thrown, so this changes the dynamic 
            of how their grappling transitions in mma. For example, having top position in jiu-jitsu is 
            not necessarily important but in MMA it gives you more leverage to strike a grounded opponent 
            and is seen more favourably on the judges scorecard.
