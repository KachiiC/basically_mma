        "description": "A jab is a type of punch used in the martial arts. Several variations of the jab exist, but every jab shares these characteristics: while in a fighting stance, the lead fist is thrown straight ahead and the arm is fully extended from the side of the torso. This process also involves a quick turn of the torso. It is an overhand punch; at the moment of impact, the pronated fist is generally held in a horizontal orientation with the palm facing the ground.",

        "discipline": "Boxing",
        "difficulty": "Easy",
        "description": "A cross (also commonly called a straight) is a punch usually thrown with the dominant hand the instant an opponent leads with his opposite hand. The blow crosses over the leading arm, hence its name. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing the body and travelling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. \n\nFor additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counterclockwise (for right-hand dominant, and clockwise for left-hand dominant) as the cross is thrown. Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer is what gives the cross its power. Like the jab, a half-step forward may be added. After the cross is thrown, the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed. It can be used to counterpunch a jab, aiming for the opponent's head (or a counter to a cross aimed at the body) or to set up a hook. The cross can also follow a jab, creating the classic “one-two” combination. The cross is also called a \"straight\" or \"right\" (“left for southpaw fighters).",

        "discipline": "Boxing",
        "difficulty": "Medium",
        "description": "A hook is a punch performed by turning the core muscles and back, thereby swinging the arm, which is bent at an angle near or at 90 degrees, in a horizontal arc into the opponent. A hook is usually aimed at the jaw, but it can also be used for body shots, especially to the liver. Hook punches can be thrown by either the lead hand or the rear hand, but the term used without a qualifier usually refers to a lead hook. The hook is a powerful punch with knockout power. \n\nWhen throwing a hook, the puncher shifts his body weight to the lead foot, allowing him to pivot his lead foot and generate kinetic energy through the hip/torso/shoulder, swinging his lead fist horizontally toward the opponent. Sometimes, depending on style and what feels comfortable to the individual, the lead foot is not pivoted. Pivoting increases the power of the punch, but leaves one lacking in options to follow up with, such as the right uppercut or right hook. Variations of the hook are the shovel hook or upper-hook; they are body punches that combine characteristics of both the hook and the uppercut. ",

        "description": "An overhand punch is a semi-circular and vertical punch thrown with the rear hand. It is usually employed when the opponent is bobbing or slipping. The strategic utility of the drop relying on body weight can deliver a great deal of power.",

        "discipline": "Boxing",
        "difficulty": "Medium",
        "description": "The uppercut  is a punch that travels along a vertical line at the opponent's chin or solar plexus. It is, along with the cross, one of the two main punches that count in the statistics as power punches. Uppercuts are useful when thrown at close range, because they are considered to cause more damage. Additionally, it is likely that a boxer would miss if the uppercut is thrown when the opponents are apart. Uppercuts usually do more damage when landed to the chin, but they can also cause damage when thrown to the body (particularly the solar plexus) or when landing on the nose or eyes. \n\nThe punch moves as its name implies: it usually initiates from the attacker's belly, making an upward motion that resembles a pirate's hook in shape, before landing on the opponent's face or body. In a conventional boxing combination, it is the second punch thrown, after the jab, but it can either initiate or finish a combination. When performing an uppercut, the attacker should stay close to the target, so as to prevent the opponent from detecting that the punch is coming, and countering with a straight punch. An uppercut from the outside loses some of its power because the arm is no longer bent at the elbow and cannot effectively transfer the total body's force in the upward movement",

        "description": "An elbow strike (commonly referred to as simply an \"elbow\") is a strike with the point of the elbow. In mma, elbows are most commonly thrown sideways similarly to a hook or upwards similarly to an uppercut (although this is a lot more difficult and a lot less common). Although this strike originates from Muay Thai where it commonly used in close range or the clinch, in mma it is also used as a strike on a grounded opponent.\n\nA \"12-6 elbow\" is a strike that is brought from a high position (\"12 o'clock\") and travels vertically toward the floor (\"6 o'clock\"), dropping the point of the elbow directly on the target is illegal in all MMA organizations that use the Unified Rules.",

        "description": "A knee strike (commonly referred to simply as a knee) is a strike with the knee, either with the kneecap or the surrounding area. Knees generally target the head or solar plexus (and sometimes the thigh) of the opposing fighter. A knee is a close range strike, so often you will see clinches in the clinch.\n\nIn MMA, knees to the head against grounded opponents are illegal.",
