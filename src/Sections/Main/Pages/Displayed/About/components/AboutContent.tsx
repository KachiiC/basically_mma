            This platform is designed by <b>Kachi Cheong</b> who himself is a huge MMA fan. The front end
            of this site uses React (typescript) and the backend uses Django Rest Framework. The static data 
            is stored within the site which is hosted on github pages. The backend server uses api requests,
            web scraping and serialization on a server hosted on heroku.

            The majority of the components are responsive and designed by Kachi using React and typescript. 
            Some of the components also use the Ant design library, React responsive and transitions.
