            As a mixed martial artist, you will not only come up against fighters of 
            all shapes and sizes but also fighters with different fighting styles. A 
            fighter (at least on paper) will always have strengths and weaknesses relative 
            to his/her opponent. Preparing a game plan for your scheduled opponent will minimise 
            the risk of being surprised during a fight. Fighters and coaches can either exploit 
            the weaknesses of their opponent or overpower their opponent by impose their skillset.

            Let’s use a kickboxing world champion as an example. Naturally they should have an 
            advantage in stand up striking against a world champion Brazilian jiu-jitsu artist.
            Therefore, the smartest gameplay for the kickboxer would be to keep the fight standing 
            and avoid being taken down at all cost (sprawl and brawl). Let’s assume in this scenario 
            that the BJJ artist will try to submit the kickboxer and avoid the standup at all cost. 
            Even if the kickboxer’s bjj skills were at a high level, inviting a take down against a 
            world champion BJJ artist and trying to submit them is not the easiest route to victory - 
            when you can easily knockout them out on the feet. It’s far better to understand your 
            strengths and weakness over your opponent before a contest than being surprised during 
            the fight.
