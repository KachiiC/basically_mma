            Today no companies have presented significant competition to the UFC which is 
            regarded as having most of the top ranked talent. Fighters usually get contracts 
            in the UFC after competing successfully in other MMA promotions from around the 
            world. Some MMA promotions tend to exist more to build up prospects while others 
            have a good mix of prospects and veterans. Many promotions exist only to be feeder 
            leagues to the bigger promotions (e.g. LFA, CWFC).

            Casual followers of the sport will often confuse "MMA" with "UFC‚Äù. Phrases such as 
            "he trains in UFC" are not uncommon. Although the UFC is often credited as the 
            organization to bring MMA into public conscientiousness, they are not the only 
            MMA organization to exist.While the UFC is top promotion in MMA, some of the top 
            talent in MMA is also pocessed by other promotions such as Bellator MMA and 
            One Championship.
