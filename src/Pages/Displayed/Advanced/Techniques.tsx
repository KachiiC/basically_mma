        <p>
            Techniques in MMA are generally categorised as either striking and grappling techniques. 
            Striking is any technique which involves punches, kicks, elbows or knees. Although 
            strikes can be thrown on the ground in MMA (commonly referred to as ground and pound), 
            striking is often a term used for techniques used from a standing position. Grappling 
            techniques are a combination of wrestling, judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Techniques 
            used in grappling include takedowns, trips, throws, sweeps, clinching and submission 
            holds. Strikes are often used in grappling exchanges when fighters are jostling for 
            position.
