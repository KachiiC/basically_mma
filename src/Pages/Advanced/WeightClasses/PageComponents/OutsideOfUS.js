            <h2>Weight Classes Outside of the United States</h2>
            <p>
                With no state or government laws regarding weight class restrictions, organizations 
                in other countries are free to schedule bouts with little regard for weight 
                differential. However, due to the increasingly competitive and international 
                nature of the sport, weight limits have been set by the promotions themselves 
                usually in alignment with the Unified Rules, as maintaining standard weight classes 
                is seen as fair and standard for all competitors.
