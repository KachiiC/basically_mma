        <h3>UFC Fighters Pay</h3>
        <p>
            Most up and coming fighters will dream of fighting in the UFC. The UFC is the 
            biggest and respected promotion in MMA, more importantly it's where you can earn 
            the most money. Needless to say, you can early a lot of money in other promotions, 
            but being in the biggest stage worldwide. 
        </p>
        <h6>Fight Purse and Bonuses</h6>
        <p>
            Most UFC fighter's contracts are structed as show money and win bonus. This means 
            fighters are paid when they fight and a bonus if they win, with the show and win 
            bonus usually being the same amount. A typical amount for a fighter making his UFC
            debut would be $10,000 to show and $10,000 to win. A UFC fighter on average will
            compete up to 3 times a year, although due to injuries and scheduling this is rarely
            the case for higher level fighters. The UFC are contractly obliged to offer you three
            fights a year (unless you are injured), if they do not offer you those three fights
            they will pay you regardless.
        </p>
        <p>
            During each event, all fighters (unless they miss weight) are eligible to fight 
            night bonuses. A $50,000 bonus is given to both fighters who compete in the 
            "Fight of the night" and two additional bonuses to "performance of the night”. 
            Historically, UFC president Dana White and former CEO Lorenzo Fertitta have also 
            given fighters undisclosed fight night bonuses.

        <h6>The Reebok Sponsorship Deal</h6>
        <p>
            In 2015, the UFC announced Reebok as its official apparel partner. This was 
            a huge step for the UFC and the sport of MMA in general, according to UFC 
            President Dana White the deal was done in order to “clean up the image of 
            the sport”. Before the Reebok deal, sponsors would pay fighters to wear their 
            merchandise before and after fights. Fighters would also have multiple logos 
            printed on their shorts for fight night. For fighters outside of the UFC, 
            this is still the case. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Reebok deal meant that all UFC athletes can only wear or use reebok 
            equipment during fight week. Promoting other brands during media days, press 
            conferences, weigh ins and post fight were no longer permitted and athletes 
            who did so would be fined by the UFC. The UFC’s biggest stars (for example 
            Conor McGregor) will have sponsorship separate deals with Reebok and would 
            earn a lot more as a result. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The benefit of this Reebok deal is that new fighters will not have to go out 
            and find sponsors. During the early portions of their career, sponsors will 
            not pay fighters much (if anything) to promote their brand. Understandably so, 
            fighters with only 5 professional fights will not bring much attention for a 
            sponsor so it’s hard to justify paying them even $1,000. However, with the Reebok 
            deal, even if you are the first fight of the night, you’ll earn $3,500 from Reebok.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem with the Reebok deal is that it caps the earning potential for 
            most of its fighters. In boxing for example fighters earn hundreds of thousands 
            for shorts sponsors alone. During fight week where MMA fighters will draw the 
            most attention due to their media obligations, only being able to promote reebok 
            reduces their earning potential.
