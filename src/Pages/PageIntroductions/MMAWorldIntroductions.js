            As with any sport, MMA has a number of legendary fighters. Although the sport has arguably
            only been around for 30 years, some athletes who have competed in the sport have ascended into 
            legendary status.

            Today no companies have presented significant competition to the UFC which is regarded as 
            having most of the top ranked talent. Fighters usually get contracts in the UFC after 
            competing successfully in other MMA promotions from around the world. Some MMA 
            promotions tend to exist more to build up prospects while others have a good mix of 
            prospects and veterans. Many promotions exist only to be feeder leagues to the bigger 
            promotions (e.g. LFA, CWFC).

            Casual followers of the sport will often confuse "MMA" with "UFC”. Phrases such as
            "he trains in UFC" are not uncommon. Although the UFC is often credited as the 
            organization to bring MMA into public conscientiousness, they are not the only MMA 
            organization to exist.While the UFC is top promotion in MMA, some of the top talent 
            in MMA is also pocessed by other promotions such as Bellator MMA and One Championship.
