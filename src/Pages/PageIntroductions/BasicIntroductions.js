            <b>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</b> is a full-contact combat sport that allows a wide variety of 
            fighting techniques and skills from a mixture of other combat sports to be used in competition. 
            The rules allow usage of both striking and grappling techniques while standing and on the ground. 
            Competitions allow athletes of different martial arts disciplines (such as boxing and wrestling)
            to compete against one another.

        <h4>How did MMA start?</h4>
        <p>
            Originally promoted as a competition with very few rules to find the most effective 
            martial arts for unarmed combat. The early days of the UFC and Pride FC, promoters would
            get martial artist who represented that combat sports to fight each other. However, as 
            the sport evolved fighters would incorporate multiple martial arts into their style.
            Mixed martial arts is (by definition) the ability to mix serval disciplines whilst 
            competing.

            MMA came to prominence in the early 1990’s, when the Ultimate Fighting 
            Championship was established in the United States, inviting the world’s 
            best fighters to compete in the Octagon to determine who reigned supreme. 
            But the sport has been around much longer than that and shares its origins 
            during man’s early history. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At its core, MMA is an amalgamation of all combat disciplines, harmoniously 
            combined together to form a seamless, unified system. Considered the purest form 
            of unarmed combat as it takes the greatest elements of various martial arts and 
            mixes them together. Many fans have fallen in love with MMA’s undeniable allure, 
            and today the sport has grown as big as any, rivaling that of other sports like 
            basketball and football. Let’s examine how the sport came to be and how 
            it all started.

            Most rule sets for mixed martial arts competitions have evolved since the early 
            days of UFC 1 and Vale Tudo. As the knowledge about fighting techniques spread 
            among fighters and spectators, it became clear that the original minimalist rule 
            systems needed to be amended.In order to get the sport sanctioned by atletic 
            comissions, promotions such as the UFC began to introduce more rules. As rules 
            evolved and regulations added, different branches of mixed martial arts have 
            emerged, with differences between the different rulesets dictating different 
            strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main motivations for these rule changes were to protect the health of the 
            fighters. The stigma of "barbaric, no rules, fighting-to-the-death" matches would 
            prevent atletic comissions from sanctioning if rules were not implemented.The 
            framework of the <b>Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts</b> was proposed and agreed upon 
            by various athletic commissions in the 2000s and was unanimously adopted by the 
            Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) on July 30, 2009.

            The <b>Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts</b> aim to provide a clear set of rules 
            governing professional MMA competition that remain consistent across the jurisdictions 
            of various athletic commissions and other regulatory bodies.The Unified Rules of MMA are listed below:

            As with any sport, before you learn about strategies and the finer details -
            you should start by learning the language of MMA. As mixed marial art is a blend 
            of all martial arts, techniques and positions generally originate from other combat
            sports. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Most striking techniques derive from sports such a boxing, muaythai or 
            taekwondo,whilst most grappling techniques and positions derive from wrestling, 
            judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
