            <b>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</b> is a full-contact combat sport that allows a wide variety of 
            fighting techniques and skills from a mixture of other combat sports to be used in competition. 
            The rules allow usage of both striking and grappling techniques while standing and on the ground. 
            Competitions allow athletes of different martial arts disciplines to compete.

            Although originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real 
            unarmed combat, competitors from different fighting styles were pitted against one another 
            in contests with relatively few rules. Later, individual fighters incorporated multiple 
            martial arts into their style. Mixed martial arts is (by definition) the ability to mix serval 
            disciplines whilst competing. In the early days of mixed martial arts, fighters only 
            knew how to do one thing. They never really “mixed” the martial arts as the name of the sport 
            would indicate they might.

            As the sport has evolved, fighters have learned the importance of being great at multiple fighting 
            disciplines. Understanding which forms of martial arts a fighter excels at and which they lack 
            in is important to help you understand what their game plan is going to be. What is MORE 
            important is to know how that style is going to match up with their opponent’s style (or styles) 
            and which is going to be more effective.

        Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) has been one of the fastest rising sports 
        in the world for the better part of the last two decades. In modern 
        times, it is a mainstream sport that enjoys a massive following from 
        millions of people all over the world in all continents. Modern day 
        MMA came to prominence in the early 1990’s, when the Ultimate Fighting 
        Championship was established in the United States, inviting the world’s 
        best fighters to compete in the Octagon to determine who reigned supreme. 
        But the sport has been around much longer than that and shares its origins 
        during man’s early history. At its core, MMA is an amalgamation of all 
        combat disciplines, harmoniously combined together to form a seamless, 
        unified system. Considered the purest form of unarmed combat as it takes 
        the greatest elements of various martial arts and mixes them together. 
        Many fans have fallen in love with MMA’s undeniable allure, and today 
        the sport has grown as big as any, rivaling that of other sports like 
        basketball and football. Let’s examine how the sport came to be and how 
        it all started.

            Most rule sets for mixed martial arts competitions have evolved since the early 
            days of UFC 1 and Vale Tudo. As the knowledge about fighting techniques spread 
            among fighters and spectators, it became clear that the original minimalist rule 
            systems needed to be amended.In order to get the sport sanctioned by atletic 
            comissions, promotions such as the UFC began to introduce more rules. As rules 
            evolved and regulations added, different branches of mixed martial arts have 
            emerged, with differences between the different rulesets dictating different 
            strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main motivations for these rule changes were to protect the health of the 
            fighters. The stigma of "barbaric, no rules, fighting-to-the-death" matches would 
            prevent atletic comissions from sanctioning if rules were not implemented.The 
            framework of the <b>Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts</b> was proposed and agreed upon 
            by various athletic commissions in the 2000s and was unanimously adopted by the 
            Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) on July 30, 2009.

            The <b>Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts</b> aim to provide a clear set of rules 
            governing professional MMA competition that remain consistent across the jurisdictions 
            of various athletic commissions and other regulatory bodies.The Unified Rules of MMA are listed below:

        As with any sport, before you learn about strategies and the finer details -
        you should start by learning the language of MMA. As mixed marial art is a blend 
        of all martial arts, techniques and positions generally originate from other combat
        sports. Most striking techniques derive from sports such a boxing, muaythai or 
        taekwondo,whilst most grappling techniques and positions derive from wrestling, 
        judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
