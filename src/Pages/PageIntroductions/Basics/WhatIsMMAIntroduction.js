            <b>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</b> is a full-contact combat sport that allows a wide variety of 
            fighting techniques and skills from a mixture of other combat sports to be used in competition. 
            The rules allow usage of both striking and grappling techniques while standing and on the ground. 
            Competitions allow athletes of different martial arts disciplines to compete.

            Although originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real 
            unarmed combat, competitors from different fighting styles were pitted against one another 
            in contests with relatively few rules. Later, individual fighters incorporated multiple 
            martial arts into their style. Mixed martial arts is (by definition) the ability to mix serval 
            disciplines whilst competing. In the early days of mixed martial arts, fighters only 
            knew how to do one thing. They never really “mixed” the martial arts as the name of the sport 
            would indicate they might.

            As the sport has evolved, fighters have learned the importance of being great at multiple fighting 
            disciplines. Understanding which forms of martial arts a fighter excels at and which they lack 
            in is important to help you understand what their game plan is going to be. What is MORE 
            important is to know how that style is going to match up with their opponent’s style (or styles) 
            and which is going to be more effective.
