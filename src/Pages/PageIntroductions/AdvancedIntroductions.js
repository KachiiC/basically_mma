            Mixed Martial Arts has many fundamentals that an individual must learn in order 
            to be successful on both a professional and amateur level. A beginner will need 
            to learn basic striking and grappling techniques, become well conditioned and 
            develop an understanding of nutrition. It is important to take into account that 
            not all beginners will be equal, some will be more athletically gifted and some 
            may be more committed to learning. Beginners will have different body shapes and 
            sizes so it will important to figure out the advantages of your body type when 
            prioritising what you want to be good at. For example, short and stocky fighters 
            are more likely to be powerful strikers and stronger grapplers, tall and skinny 
            fighters can develop into good counter strikers and have better leverage when it 
            comes to choke submissions.

            Fighters transitioning from another martial art will have a general understanding 
            of some of the fundamentals. Let’s take a boxer transitioning to MMA as an example, 
            a well trained boxer would probably have a good understanding of how to strike, the 
            level of endurance and nutirition needed to train. This would in theory give them a 
            distinct advantage over an absolute beginner. However, a boxer will have habits such 
            as footwork or clinching when stunned that need to be corrected before becoming 
            successful at MMA. A boxer with no grappling background may still struggle against a 
            low level grappler who has only been drilling for a few months. This is not to say 
            boxers will never succeed but if your game plan is to win with strikes, then an 
            emphasis must also be placed grappling defence. Below I have outlined six fundamentals 
            which I feel are most important to fighters when competing in MMA.

        <p>Techniques in MMA are generally categorised as either striking and 
            grappling techniques. Striking is any technique which involves punches, 
            kicks, elbows or knees. Although strikes can be thrown on the ground in MMA 
            (commonly referred to as ground and pound), striking is often a term used for 
            techniques used from a standing position. Grappling techniques are a combination 
            of wrestling, judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Techniques used in grappling include 
            takedowns, trips, throws, sweeps, clinching and submission holds. Strikes are 
            often used in grappling exchanges when fighters are jostling for position.

            As a mixed martial artist, you will not only come up against fighters of all 
            shapes and sizes but also fighters with different fighting styles. A fighter 
            (at least on paper) will always have strengths and weaknesses relative to his/her 
            opponent. Preparing a game plan for your scheduled opponent will minimise the risk 
            of being surprised during a fight. Fighters and coaches can either exploit the 
            weaknesses of their opponent or overpower their opponent by impose their skillset.

            Let’s use a kickboxing world champion as an example. Naturally they should have an 
            advantage in stand up striking against a world champion Brazilian jiu-jitsu artist. 
            Therefore, the smartest gameplay for the kickboxer would be to keep the fight standing 
            and avoid being taken down at all cost (sprawl and brawl). Let’s assume in this scenario 
            that the BJJ artist will try to submit the kickboxer and avoid the standup at all cost. 
            Even if the kickboxer’s bjj skills were at a high level, inviting a take down against 
            a world champion BJJ artist and trying to submit them is not the easiest route to 
            victory - when you can easily knockout them out on the feet. It’s far better to 
            understand your strengths and weakness over your opponent before a contest than being 
            surprised during the fight.

        The more you follow the sport, the more you will begin to hear about Fighter Pay. 
        At the end of the day, combat sports is prize fighting so negoiating pay is a huge 
        part of any sport. Fighter pay is often discussed privately and understandably so, 
        having your salary announced to the work would be uncomfortable to anymore let alone 
        prize fighters. Although as fans and observers we maybe interested in how much our 
        favourite athletes are paid, in MMA most promotions are mostly private companies, 
        so they are under no obligation to disclose their fighter’s pay. Some athletic 
        commissions such as Nevada and California require promotions to disclosure fighter 
        pay when events are held in their state.

        <p>
            Before weight classes existed, fighters would compete in open weight tournments.
            In a time where the sport did not yet have a name and prior to state sanctioning, 
            weight classes were not mandatory since the competitions were held without the approval 
            of the athletic commissions. The UFC first introduced two weight classes at UFC 12, 
            which grouped competitors above 200 lb (91 kg) as heavyweights and competitors 
            under 200 lb as lightweights. Weight divisions underwent many changes in the 
            years to follow, but the ability for promotions to autonomously decide their own 
            weight classes eventually disappeared after athletic commissions began supervising 
            mixed martial arts.

            In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were codified by the New Jersey 
            State Athletic Commission. The California State Athletic Commission had worked 
            extensively on regulation, but their sanctioning of MMA was not implemented due to 
            state governmental issues surrounding the process. California officially sanctioned
            MMA on December 28, 2005, using the ruleset it helped devise five years previously.
            Since then, to create uniformity, all state commissions in the United States that
            regulate mixed martial arts have assimilated these rules into their existing 
            unarmed combat competition rules and statutes. For a promotion to hold mixed 
            martial arts events in a state-sanctioned venue, the promotion must abide by the 
            state athletic commission's body of rules for weight limits.
