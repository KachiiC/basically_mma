            The more you follow the sport, the more you will begin to hear about Fighter Pay. 
            At the end of the day, combat sports is prize fighting so negoiating pay is a huge 
            part of any sport. Fighter pay is often discussed privately and understandably so, 
            having your salary announced to the work would be uncomfortable to anymore let alone 
            prize fighters. Although as fans and observers we maybe interested in how much our 
            favourite athletes are paid, in MMA most promotions are mostly private companies, 
            so they are under no obligation to disclose their fighterâ€™s pay. Some athletic 
            commissions such as Nevada and California require promotions to disclosure fighter 
            pay when events are held in their state.
