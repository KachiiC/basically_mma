            Before weight classes existed, fighters would compete in open weight tournments.
            In a time where the sport did not yet have a name and prior to state sanctioning, 
            weight classes were not mandatory since the competitions were held without the approval 
            of the athletic commissions. The UFC first introduced two weight classes at UFC 12, 
            which grouped competitors above 200 lb (91 kg) as heavyweights and competitors 
            under 200 lb as lightweights. Weight divisions underwent many changes in the 
            years to follow, but the ability for promotions to autonomously decide their own 
            weight classes eventually disappeared after athletic commissions began supervising 
            mixed martial arts.

            In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were codified by the New Jersey 
            State Athletic Commission. The California State Athletic Commission had worked 
            extensively on regulation, but their sanctioning of MMA was not implemented due to 
            state governmental issues surrounding the process. California officially sanctioned
            MMA on December 28, 2005, using the ruleset it helped devise five years previously.
            Since then, to create uniformity, all state commissions in the United States that
            regulate mixed martial arts have assimilated these rules into their existing 
            unarmed combat competition rules and statutes. For a promotion to hold mixed 
            martial arts events in a state-sanctioned venue, the promotion must abide by the 
            state athletic commission's body of rules for weight limits.
