                <p>Techniques in MMA are generally categorised as either striking and 
                    grappling techniques. Striking is any technique which involves punches, 
                    kicks, elbows or knees. Although strikes can be thrown on the ground in MMA 
                    (commonly referred to as ground and pound), striking is often a term used for 
                    techniques used from a standing position. Grappling techniques are a combination 
                    of wrestling, judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Techniques used in grappling include 
                    takedowns, trips, throws, sweeps, clinching and submission holds. Strikes are 
                    often used in grappling exchanges when fighters are jostling for position.
