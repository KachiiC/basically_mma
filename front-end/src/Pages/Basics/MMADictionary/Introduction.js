        <h2>Mixed Martial Arts Terms</h2>
        <p>As with any sport, before you learn about strategies and the finer details -
            you should start by learning the language of MMA. As mixed marial art is a blend 
            of all martial arts, techniques and positions generally originate from other combat
            sports. Most striking techniques derive from sports such a boxing, muaythai or 
            taekwondo,whilst most grappling techniques and positions derive from wrestling, 
            judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the defintions below do not cover every word you'll hear during an MMA
            broadcast, I feel these terms will cover most things a beginner will not know and
            a good starting block to build upon.
