                Contestants must complete all pre-licensure medical examinations and tests required 
                by the jurisdiction licensing the contest. The jurisdiction licensing the contest 
                shall conduct or supervise all pre-contest weigh-ins and may hold or supervise a 
                rules meeting for all contestants and their cornermen.

                Immediately following a contest, each contestant shall be given a medical 
                examination by a physician appointed by the commission. The medical examination 
                may include any examinations or tests the commission deems necessary to determine 
                the post-contest physical fitness of a contestant. Any contestant who refuses to 
                submit to a post-contest medical examination shall be immediately suspended for an 
                indefinite period.
