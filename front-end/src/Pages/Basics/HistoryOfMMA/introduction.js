            <h1>History of Mixed Martial Arts</h1>
            <p> 
                Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) has been one of the fastest rising sports 
                in the world for the better part of the last two decades. In modern 
                times, it is a mainstream sport that enjoys a massive following from 
                millions of people all over the world in all continents. Modern day 
                MMA came to prominence in the early 1990’s, when the Ultimate Fighting 
                Championship was established in the United States, inviting the world’s 
                best fighters to compete in the Octagon to determine who reigned supreme. 
                But the sport has been around much longer than that and shares its origins 
                during man’s early history. At its core, MMA is an amalgamation of all 
                combat disciplines, harmoniously combined together to form a seamless, 
                unified system. Considered the purest form of unarmed combat as it takes 
                the greatest elements of various martial arts and mixes them together. 
                Many fans have fallen in love with MMA’s undeniable allure, and today 
                the sport has grown as big as any, rivaling that of other sports like 
                basketball and football. Let’s examine how the sport came to be and how 
                it all started.
